<pre>
A Python program is read by a parser. Python was designed to be a highly readable
language. The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules which defines
how a Python program will be written.
</pre>
<br>
<font size = '6' face = 'ariel'>Python Line Structure</font>
<pre>
	A Python program is divided into a number of logical lines and every logical
line is terminated by the token NEWLINE. A logical line is created from one or more
physical lines.A line contains only spaces, tabs, formfeeds possibly a comment,
is known as a blank line, and Python interpreter ignores it.A physical line is a
sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line sequence
(in windows it is called CR LF or return followed by a linefeed and in Unix, it is called LF or linefeed).
</pre>

<br>
<br>
<a name = "comments"><font size = '6' face = 'ariel'>Comments in Python</font></a>
<pre>
A comment begins with a hash character(#) which is not a part of the string
literal and ends at the end of the physical line. All characters after the #
character up to the end of the line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter
ignores them. See the following example. It should be noted that Python has no multi-lines
or block comments facility.
</pre>
<img src = "02.png" height = "495.25" width = "727.66"/>
<br>
<font size = '6' face = 'ariel'>Joining two lines</font>
<pre>
	When you want to write a long code in a single line you can break the logical
	line in two or more physical lines using backslash character(\). Therefore when
	a physical line ends with a backslash characters(\) and not a part of a string literal
	or comment then it can join another physical line. See the following example
</pre>
<img src = "03.png" height = "495.25" width = "727.66"/>
<br>
<font size = '6' face = 'ariel'>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</font>
<pre>
You can write two separate statements into a single line using a semicolon (;) character between two line
</pre>
<img src = "04.png" height = "495.25" width = "727.66"/>
<br>
<font size = '6' face = 'ariel'>Indentation</font>
<pre>
Python uses whitespace (spaces and tabs) to define program blocks whereas other
languages like C, C++ use braces ({}) to indicate blocks of codes for class, functions
or flow control. The number of whitespaces (spaces and tabs) in the indentation is not fixed,
but all statements within the block must be the indented same amount. In the following program,
the block statements have no indentation.

This is a program with single space indentation
</pre>
<img src = "05.png" height = "495.25" width = "727.66"/>
<pre>This is a program with single tab indentation</pre>
<img src = "06.png" height = "495.25" width = "727.66"/>
<pre>Here is an another program with an indentation of a single space + a single tab.</pre>
<img src = "07.png" height = "495.25" width = "727.66"/>
<br>
<br>
<font size = '6' face = 'ariel'>Python Coding Style</font>
<pre>
	-> Use 4 spaces per indentation and no tabs.
	-> Do not mix tabs and spaces. Tabs create confusion and it is recommended to use only spaces.
	-> Maximum line length : 79 characters which help users with a small display.
	-> Use blank lines to separate top-level function and class definitions and single blank
	   line to separate methods definitions inside a class and larger blocks of code inside functions.
	-> When possible, put inline comments (should be complete sentences).
	-> Use spaces around expressions and statements.

<a name="operators"><font size = "13" face = "ariel">Python Operators</font></a>
<pre>In computer programming languages operators are special symbols which represent computations,
conditional matching etc. The values the operator uses are called operands.

c = a + b
Here a and b are called operands and '+' is an operator
Python supports following operators.

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Assignment Operators
Bitwise Operator
Conditional Operators</pre>

<hr>
<pre>
Conditional expressions or ternary operator have the lowest priority of all Python
operations. The expression x if C else y first evaluates the condition, C (not x);
if C is true, x is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated
and its value is returned.

<pre>Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the
process of importing it. The import statement is the most common way of invoking
the import machinery, but it is not the only way. Functions such as importlib.import_module()
and built-in __import__() can also be used to invoke the import machinery.

The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module,
then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search
operation of the import statement is defined as a call to the __import__() function,
with the appropriate arguments. The return value of __import__() is used to perform
the name binding operation of the import statement. See the import statement for the exact
details of that name binding operation.

A direct call to __import__() performs only the module search and, if found,
the module creation operation. While certain side-effects may occur, such as the
importing of parent packages, and the updating of various caches (including sys.modules),
only the import statement performs a name binding operation.

When calling __import__() as part of an import statement, the standard builtin
__import__() is called. Other mechanisms for invoking the import system (such as importlib.import_module())
may choose to subvert __import__() and use its own solution to implement import semantics.

When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if found, it
creates a module object [1], initializing it. If the named module cannot be found,
a ModuleNotFoundError is raised. Python implements various strategies to search for
the named module when the import machinery is invoked. These strategies can be modified
and extended by using various hooks described in the sections below.

Changed in version 3.3: The import system has been updated to fully implement the
second phase of PEP 302. There is no longer any implicit import machinery - the full
import system is exposed through sys.meta_path. In addition, native namespace package
support has been implemented </pre>
